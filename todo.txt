- document the 3 pieces and wha they do: client (the pi doing stuff), 
  server (routing messages around and logging things to the db), 
  and UI (controlling things and displaying status)
- When the controls are turned on, create a new runId and save off the settings/controls that were used for that runId. 
    - Might make more sense to just create a new ID for every settings change. I think that's the way it's actually working right now
    
- automatically start redis-server when the server launches if not already running?
    - redis-server on my mac is what I use
- Does it even make sense to namespace the socket message channels with io:? Could just make it one-to-one with the rest apis
  
- Make sure redis server is configured with the right save options so we don't lose data when we lose power (see my redis notes)
- Could change the socketio writes in the put handlers to just use a pub/sub on redis rather than doing it directly in the rest endpoint
- clean up the dataDefinitions so they are generic rather than temps? Or maybe get it all working for the temps first and then make it generic
- Would be nice to switch the tsc options to create a single output file if could figure it out


- May want to move some of the UI assets from CDN to just on the pi? Probably not though, the browser should be running on a machine that has full internet access
- logos


Next steps:
  - Put the messages in there too (at least the last handful of messages)

- Clean up the chart labels. Labeling every single point with full date/time isn't going to work

- Create a controlPanel top section in the UI. Still not sure I like the accordian stuff on the UI. Just show them all as cards/panes and have them always visible? Maybe the spot where you configure new settings doesn't need to be always visible though


- ensure type validity on output of server (maybe input too). At minimum be flexible on input, strict on output/db storage

- Times of things should be controlled by server? Maybe both client and server?

- Have the server serve up the UI build rather than having to run that as a separate server. Maybe make the build of the UI project copy it into the server www directory (and mark it as git ignore)
- overall build script that builds everything from the root
- pi install script? Something that would install and set up redis?
- Actually test it on a pi with some real measurements - better example than smoker and makes more sense to document/blog that. Maybe wifi strength, download speed, ping time, or something like that. Settings to configure poll intervals and what it will ping
- Clean up logs & typescript. Replace fetch promises with await. Can we bind the socket .on calls with a this so can clean up the self stuff?
- add a temperature probe? Just to give it something real to measure? There's a built-in way to measure the cpu temp

- Update the readme, add the appropriate tags, make sure the repo is public (can't remember if I made it that way)
- blog it!

- load previous runs and chart them
