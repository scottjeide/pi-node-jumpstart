My basic backlog



- automatically start redis-server when the server launches if not already running? redis-server on my mac is what I use
- Make sure redis server is configured with the right save options so we don't lose data when we lose power (see my redis notes)

- overall build script that builds everything from the root
- Have the server project express serve up the UI build rather than having to run that as a separate server. Maybe make the build of the UI project copy it into the server www directory (and mark it as git ignore)
- pi install script? Something that would install and set up redis? Install the client & server apps to start at boot/init


- ensure type validity on output of server (maybe input too). At minimum be flexible on input, strict on output/db storage

- Would be nice to switch the tsc options to create a single output file if could figure it out
- clean up typescript warnings/suggestions


- Update the readme, add the appropriate tags
- document the 3 pieces and wha they do: client (the pi doing stuff),  server (routing messages around and logging things to the db),  and UI (controlling things and displaying status)
- Document how to build/debug various components (include debug configs in vscode dot file somehow?)
- blog it!


- load previous runs/settings ids and display the measurements and messages for them
