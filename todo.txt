- document the 3 pieces and wha they do: client (the pi doing stuff), 
  server (routing messages around and logging things to the db), 
  and UI (controlling things and displaying status)
- When the controls are turned on, create a new runId and save off the settings/controls that were used for that runId
- automatically start redis-server when the server launches if not already running?
    - redis-server on my mac is what I use
- Get the .vscode/launch.json stuff setup to be able to use debug configs
- Does it even make sense to namespace the socket message channels with io:? Could just make it one-to-one with the rest apis
- does the client and server code even need webpack? https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-tutorial
  - Seems like it doesn't. typescript's tsc command looks like it also packages up to a single js file
  - And if I switch to those will it make me unable to use newer es6 stuff?, or maybe make it easier to debug
  - Next time I finally jump on this, try removing the webpack stuff and see if that works and makes debugging any easier

  - run 'npx tsc' from the server directory to build
  
- Make sure redis server is configured with the right save options so we don't lose data when we lose power (see my redis notes)
- Could change the socketio writes in the put handlers to just use a pub/sub on redis rather than doing it directly
- clean up the dataDefinitions so they are generic rather than temps? Or maybe get it all working for the temps first and then make it generic
