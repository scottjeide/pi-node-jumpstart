- document the 3 pieces and wha they do: client (the pi doing stuff), 
  server (routing messages around and logging things to the db), 
  and UI (controlling things and displaying status)
- When the controls are turned on, create a new runId and save off the settings/controls that were used for that runId
- automatically start redis-server when the server launches if not already running
    - ./redis-server on my mac is what I use
- Get the .vscode/launch.json stuff setup to be able to use debug configs
- Does it even make sense to namespace the socket message channels with io:? Could just make it one-to-one with the rest apis
