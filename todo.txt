- document the 3 pieces and wha they do: client (the pi doing stuff), 
  server (routing messages around and logging things to the db), 
  and UI (controlling things and displaying status)
- When the controls are turned on, create a new runId and save off the settings/controls that were used for that runId
- automatically start redis-server when the server launches if not already running?
    - redis-server on my mac is what I use
- Does it even make sense to namespace the socket message channels with io:? Could just make it one-to-one with the rest apis
- typescript 
  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling
  - run 'npx tsc' from the server directory to build, or I just installed it globally (npm install -g typescript)
  
- Make sure redis server is configured with the right save options so we don't lose data when we lose power (see my redis notes)
- Could change the socketio writes in the put handlers to just use a pub/sub on redis rather than doing it directly
- clean up the dataDefinitions so they are generic rather than temps? Or maybe get it all working for the temps first and then make it generic
- Would be nice to switch the tsc options to create a single output file if could figure it output

- Figure out how to initialize the props in the data definitions to defaults in the dataDefinitions file. otherwise every time
you add a new measurement or something you need to initialize it in the places in the client/server/ui code that are creating one

- May want to move some of the UI assets from CDN to just on the pi? Probably not though, the browser should be running on a machine that has full internet access
- logos

- Not sure I really like the two different tabs on the UI. Might be cleaner with them all on a single page. Maybe just control panel and status together on 
the main page, and then previous runs on a separate page. Not really necessary to switch pages to turn on/off and to look at current status

Next steps:
- On controlPanel
  - rename controlPanel - just settings. ControlPanel contains a current settings, on/off and any other control switches and indicators?
  - maybe messages?
  - controlPanel is a single object that is the on/off, any other switches and indicators, and messages? I don't know. Still don't really know exactly what I want here
  - currentSettings is the only endpoint that will broadcast over the socket. Other settings can just be loaded/saved (eventually)
  - controlPanel could just be a UI concept that can be used to change the currentSettings (on/off, control switches, etc) and display messages or status?
  - Maybe have a status that goes from client to server? current measurements or pin readings?
